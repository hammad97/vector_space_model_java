# vector_space_model_java
This is my sixth semester project and in this project i have implemented Vector Space Model (VSM) in Java to perform information retrieval.  Here we again use Shakespeare works to perform searches on but this time results are better as compare to Boolean model as it follows TF-IDF approach.
